How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flex Box and CSS Grid, Media queries


The symmetric structure of this deliverable really provided a great learning opportunity to get a good grasp of using CSS Grid.

Optimizations:
The optimizations for this one focused mostly on making sure the text would wrap and display correctly for the user. 
Text can be a bit pesky when using Media queries but its often one of the most important aspects for the user for site navigation



I was able to really learn a lot and see first hand why CSS Grid is so powerful for blocking out the overall layout of a website!
